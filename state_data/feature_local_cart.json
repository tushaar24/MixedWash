  "developers_notes": "The local_cart feature is designed with a platform-agnostic approach using expect/actual declarations for database implementations. This allows for native database solutions on each platform while maintaining a consistent API. The feature currently uses SQLDelight for cross-platform database operations, which works well but requires platform-specific implementations. The cart implementation is entirely local, which means cart data is not synchronized across devices for the same user - this could be a future enhancement by integrating with a remote cart service. The repository returns results wrapped in Kotlin's Result class, which is a good practice for error handling but means consumers must handle potential failures explicitly. Flow is used for reactive updates, which enables real-time UI updates across the app when cart changes occur."
