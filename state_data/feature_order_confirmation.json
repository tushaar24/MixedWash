  "developers_notes": "The order_confirmation feature is intentionally simple, functioning primarily as a UI component at the end of the order flow rather than performing business logic. Its main responsibility is to provide a clear confirmation to users that their order was successful and offer navigation options for next steps. The feature currently does not retrieve or display detailed order information, which could be a potential enhancement to show order number, estimated delivery time, or other order-specific details. The success animation is implemented using Compose animation APIs and could be refined for better performance on lower-end devices. This feature has minimal dependencies on other components, making it stable and less prone to breaking changes."
